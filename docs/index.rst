Camoco is a python library for building and analyzing co-expression networks. 
Currently, networks are generally built from gene expression data, but given 
that the input to Camoco is simply a gene-by-sample expression matrix, there 
is not reason that the analysis couldn't include things like protein abundance 
or metabolites. Hence the name: co-analysis of molecular components. Very 
breifly, Camoco creates co-expression networks using table formatted expression 
data and and a few common genome data files:
